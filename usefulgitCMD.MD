## if file is removed in local repo and want to remove in remote, do this first
#### git rm --cache path/to/file

Once we run the command, We can add, commit and push the changes now. 


## to push a empty directory, create a hidden file inside the directory
touch directoryname/.empty_file

Please rem, the .empty_file is a file not a directory.
